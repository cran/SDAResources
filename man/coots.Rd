\item{csize:}{number of eggs in clutch (\eqn{M_i})}

\item{length:}{length of egg (mm)}

\item{breadth:}{maximum breadth of egg (mm)}

\item{volume:}{calculated as 0.000507*length*\eqn{breadth^2} (\eqn{mm^3})}

\item{tmt:}{

= 1 if received supplemental feeding

= 0 otherwise}

\description{
Selected information on egg size, from a larger study by Arnold (1991). Data
