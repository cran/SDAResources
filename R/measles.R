#' measles data
#'
#' 
#' Roberts et al. (1995) reported on the results of a survey of parents whose
#'children had not been immunized against measles during a recent campaign to immunize
#'all children in the first five years of secondary school. The original data were unavailable;
#'univariate and multivariate summary statistics from these artificial data, however, are consistent 
#'with those in the paper. All variables are coded as 1 for yes, 0 for no, and NA for
#'no answer. A parent who refused consent (variable 4) was asked why, with responses in
#'variables 5 through 10. If a response in variables 5 through 10 was checked, it was assigned
#'value 1; otherwise, it was assigned value 0. A parent could give more than one reason for
#'not having the child immunized.
